* In this project when we want to login to the application we need to enter the correct "Email address" and "password" both email address and password are mandatory or u can use 'login with Email'. 
* I have done this Authentication using 'AUTHO' by creating account in AUTH0 api provider.
* After login into the application we can able to see the login credentials (details of mine on the screen)and after log out we cannot able to see them.
